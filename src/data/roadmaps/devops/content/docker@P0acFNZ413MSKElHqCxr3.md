# Docker

Docker is a platform for working with containerized applications. Among its features are a daemon and client for managing and interacting with containers, registries for storing images, and a desktop application to package all these features together. Containers are lightweight and portable, providing a consistent and reliable way to deploy applications across different environments.

## History

Docker was founded in 2010 by *Solomon Hykes*, and the first version of Docker was released in 2013. Docker became an open-source project in 2014, and since then, it has gained massive popularity in the software development industry.

## Key Features

Docker provides several key features that make it an attractive choice for developers:

- **Lightweight**: Containers are much lighter than virtual machines, making them faster to spin up and down.
- **Portable**: Containers are portable across different environments, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Isolated**: Containers provide a high level of isolation between applications, ensuring that each application runs independently without interfering with others.
- **Efficient**: Containers use fewer resources than virtual machines, making them more efficient.
