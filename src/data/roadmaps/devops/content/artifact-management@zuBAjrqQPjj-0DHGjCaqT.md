# Artifacts

Artifacts refer to the output of a build process, typically generated by a Continuous Integration (CI) tool. These outputs can be executable files, libraries, documents, or any other type of file that is produced as a result of building, compiling, or packaging code.

## Artifacts can include

- Compiled binaries (e.g., .exe, .dll, .jar)
- Libraries (e.g., .so, .dll)
- Packages (e.g., .zip, .tar.gz, .rpm)
- Documents (e.g., .pdf, .docx)
- Configuration files (e.g., .properties, .yaml)
- Images (e.g., Docker images)
